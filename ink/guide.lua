The guide: what Ink Away can do that a glance doesn't show, as short cards
under topics, opened from Settings (ink/view/guide.lua shows it). Plain data:
adding a feature is adding a card here, in the same commit, and
tests/guide.lua checks every card (its icons exist, its text is short, its
"Show me" opens something).

A topic: { id, title, line (under its title in the index), icon, when, cards }.
A card:
  glyph or icon   a gesture glyph (ink/icons/ges_*) or a tool icon (ink/icons)
  title, text     what it is, in a few words and a sentence or two
  when            where it applies (Guide.WHEN; a list means all of them)
  show            the sheet its "Show me" opens (ink/view/guide.lua)
  gesture_of      a book feature: the card shows the gesture it got
                  (ink/reader/entrygestures.lua), not a fixed one
  trigger         a gesture or pen button (ink/actions.lua): its current action
                  is the card's title, and a trigger set to Nothing hides it
Plain Lua: the headless tests drive it.
