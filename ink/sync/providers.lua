The cloud services the sync can use. A provider is a module with these
members (see ink/sync/providers/dropbox.lua, gdrive.lua and onedrive.lua, and
tests/sync/mockcloud.lua for a pretend one the tests use). Adding another service
means writing one more module like them and listing it here; the engine, the
settings and the screens do not change.

    AUTH                         "code": the person types a code from the phone into
                                 the reader; "device": the reader shows a code, the
                                 person types it on the phone, the reader waits
    HOSTS                        the hosts it may speak to ("*.example.com" for any below)
    beginAuth(app_key, app_secret) -> pending: { url, verifier } for "code" (an address
                                 to open on a phone), or { kind = "device", url,
                                 user_code, device_code, interval, expires_at }
    finishAuth(app_key, code, verifier) -> account record   ("code" only; what to keep)
    pollAuth(app_key, pending, app_secret) -> account record ("device" only), or
                                 nil and IA-S206 while the person has not allowed it yet
    new(account, opts)           -> an instance (opts: app_key, app_secret, now, save,
                                 dir for files of its own), which has:
      :accountInfo()             -> { id, name, email }

      :download(rel, rev, dest)  -> { rev, size, hash }
      :upload(src, rel, expect)  -> { rev, size, hash }; `expect` is the revision the
                                    file builds on (nil: it must not exist yet), and a
                                    file changed meanwhile is refused with IA-S305
      :delete(rel, rev)
      :revisions(rel)            -> { { rev, size, mtime, current } }
      :restore(rel, rev)         -> { rev, size, hash }
      :hashFile(path, like)      -> (optional) the hash of a local file in the kind the
                                    service gives, `like` being one of its hashes;
                                    without it the file's Dropbox content hash is used

Every call returns its result, or nil and an error from ink/sync/errors.lua.
