Pure pen helpers for palm rejection, testable without KOReader.

KOReader hands a plugin raw stylus events through Input:registerStylusCallback
(frontend/device/input.lua). The callback runs before gesture detection, once per
input frame while the pen is present, with a slot table {slot, id, x, y, tool,
timev}; returning true "dominates" the event so it never becomes a gesture.

Tool values are the ABS_MT_TOOL_TYPE constants KOReader uses: finger 0, pen 1,
eraser 2, highlighter 3.

-- What a routed slot physically is. Input:routeStylusEvents hands the callback
-- any slot with a pen, eraser or highlighter tool, or on the dedicated pen slot,
-- so a routed slot is not necessarily the pen: Linux reports a rejected touch as
-- MT_TOOL_PALM, the same value (2) as the eraser, so a resting palm arrives
-- looking like the eraser.
--
-- The tool type comes first. A pen tip always reports TOOL_PEN (1), so TOOL_PEN
-- is trusted even where Input.pen_slot is never set; on a Wacom device whose
-- pen slot is known, only that slot is the pen (see below). The slot settles the
-- ambiguous eraser value: a stylus tool on the pen's own slot (preset by the
-- runtime, or learned from the first real pen frame) or, off Wacom, with a
-- barrel-button latch is the pen; any other bare 2 or 3 is a promoted palm.
--
-- `facts` carries what only the live Input object knows:
--   pen_slot          the digitizer's dedicated slot number (or nil)
--   learned_slot      the slot a genuine TOOL_PEN frame was last seen on
--   wacom             true on a Wacom protocol device (Kindle Scribe, reMarkable)
--   eraser_latch      Input.stylus_eraser_active (a held barrel button)
